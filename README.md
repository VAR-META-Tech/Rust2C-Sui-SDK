# Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up on macOS platforms. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed to build the project:

## Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio Code** with C++ development environment
- **Install Sui** Follow this guide to install Sui https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install
## Project Setup
Run follow command to setting Envá»‰roment befor testing:
1. Check Sui Client Environment:  
    ```sh 
    Sui client envs
    ```
 **NOTE:If you dont have DevNet Please Run CMD :**
```sh 
    sui client new-env --alias devnet --rpc https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
```
2. Switch to devnet network: 
    ```sh 
    sui client switch --env devnet
    ```
3. Check current network:
    ```sh 
    sui client active-env
    ```

    ```
7. Build Project:
     ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```
